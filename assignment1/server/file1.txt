That is, since we can not move U’s read-write head in different directions at once,
we simply move the parallel tapes “under” the head. To simulate a single step of M, we
shift all the nonblank symbols in each of these parallel tapes until the head’s position
in these parallel tapes corresponds to the heads’ positions of M’s k tapes. For example,
if k = 3 and in some particular step M’s transition function specifies the movements
    L, R, R, then U will shift all the nonblank entries of its first parallel tape one cell to the
    right, and shift the nonblank entries of its second and third tapes one cell to the left (see
    Figure 1.8). U can easily perform such shifts using an additional “scratch” work tape.
    The approach above is still not good enough to get O(T log T)-time simulation. The
    reason is that there may be as many as T nonblank symbols in each parallel tape, and so
    each shift operation may cost U as much as T operations per each step of M, resulting
    in $(T 2 )-time simulation.
